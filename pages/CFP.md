## Green Data Mining
2nd International Workshop on Energy Efficient Scalable Data Mining and Machine Learning  
Co-located with ECML-PKDD 2019.    
Conference Dates: September 16-20, 2019  
Workshop Date: September 16, 2019 Würzburg, Germany     
Website: [greendatamining.github.io](https://greendatamining.github.io)    


## Scope

This workshop aims to bring together people from different areas and backgrounds in data mining and machine learning that have a common interest in scalability, edge computing, and energy efficiency.
These fields include, but are not limited to: deep learning, Internet of Things (IoT), scalable machine learning, systems for machine learning, information retrieval systems, and stream mining.
The goal is to provide a venue where researchers with heterogeneous backgrounds can debate and discuss challenges related to building energy efficient machine learning algorithms, systems, and hardware platforms.  

We accept original work, already completed, or in progress. Position papers and extended abstracts are also welcomed.  
**All accepted papers (except for extended abstracts) will be published in ECML-PKDD 2019 Workshop proceedings.**

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Scalable Machine Learning
* Energy-efficient model training, and inference
* Energy-efficient Data Mining
